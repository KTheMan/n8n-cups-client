### **Getting this going**

To use this custom image, which is tailored for n8n and includes the necessary dependencies for the [n8n-printer-node](https://github.com/DtNeo/n8n-printer-node), replace the image included in the [n8n docker install documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) with this one: 

```
ghcr.io/ktheman/n8n-cups-client:latest
```
